# AI_RAG_Model
This project implements a complete Modular RAG Pipeline with the Gemini LLM. It ingests multiformat documents (PDF, Excel, Images via OCR), converts them to embeddings using Sentence-Transformers, and indexes them in ChromaDB. The system provides context-grounded answers with Confidence Scores , ensuring output is accurate and traceable.
